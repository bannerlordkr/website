## Save & Load
Further stability tweaks for save and load.  

## Battles and Sieges
Fixed a bug that opened a siege battle instead of field battle when attacking a besieger party.  

## Combat AI
Night debuffs, visibility limitation and extra aim error of ranged units have been removed.  

## Clan and Party
Fixed the open hands issue in the banner editor.  
After some time during a campaign, some lords were remaining without troops in their party because of financial problems and constantly being harassed by bandits. Lords now manage their finances more effectively and take troops from garrisons if they are at risk of going bankrupt. This was one reason for the snowball effect in the campaign, with kingdoms being eliminated too easily.  
Minor fixes have been made regarding pregnancies.  
Fixed an issue that caused player clan members to get stuck in a settlement.  

## Kingdoms and Diplomacy
Fixed an issue with defensive battles after a safe passage barter had been made.  

## Crafting
Fixed an issue that prevented axes from being craftable at the smithy.  

## Issues & Quests
Fixed a bug with the AI trying to attack at the end of Army of Poachers quest.  

## Other
More than 200 items reintroduced to the game.  
Armor values and prices overhauled.  
Production of weapons and armors in towns tweaked.  
Aseraiâ€™s basic troop was Aserai Tribesman, however, it should be Aserai Recruit. This is fixed.
